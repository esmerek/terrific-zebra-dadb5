    subtitle: Epic Fusion is where digital first meets human.

    content: >
      Epic Fusion is a digital-first team. We connect New Work ideas with
      high-value solutions. That's how we enable true, digital transformation.
      Our credo: No Excuses. We live the digital future ourselves, creating more
      space for us as people.


      In today's globally networked markets, digitalization is increasingly
      entering all areas of our lives. Tasks are increasingly being replaced by
      automation and artificial intelligence. This results not only in
      simplifications and improvements, but also in increasing complexity and a
      lack of orientation.


      For Epic Fusion, it is therefore essential to leverage human potential in
      its uniqueness. Social skills such as empathy, creativity and innovation
      cannot be replaced with artificial intelligence. However, we should
      question the organization of teams and ways of working. What motivates
      employees? How do we strengthen trust? What happens when teams regulate
      themselves instead of being controlled by others? With the right answers,
      unimagined potential can be activated.


      To unleash such potential, Epic Fusion creates solutions around the
      digital workplace of the future. From technology to ways of working to
      team structuring. We share our experience and expertise with you, guiding
      you safely and purposefully through the digital transformation.

    subtitle: Collective Digital First at Epic Fusion
    image_alt: lorem-ipsum
    content: >
      In line with the Digital First devise, we organize ourselves according to
      innovative ideas and structures. Epic Fusion knows no hierarchy, no bosses
      and no fixed office workplaces. And no fixed vacations - our employees
      organize their working and vacation time themselves.


      The following five principles guide us to sustainable success in our
      day-to-day work:


      1.  "We over Me"

      2.  "Purpose over Profits"

      3.  "Progress over Perfection"

      4.  "Learn-It over Know-It"

      5.  "Experiment over Certainity"



      We are committed to an evolutionary organization of shared authority and
      collective intelligence. We believe in the power of experimentation and
      see obstacles as opportunities. This is how we continuously evolve and
      grow. We are a team committed to common goals and celebrating success
      together.
