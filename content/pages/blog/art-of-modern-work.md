### Why Modern Work

Technology, society and organizations have changed increasingly fast over the past few years - and so has the way we work. We need to respond to these changes in a future-proof way. To remain competitive, organizations must become even more agile and able to adapt to new constraints.

### Radical Changes

We live in a digital knowledge era with global markets. It is intended that tasks will be replaced by robotics and artificial intelligence. Organizations must learn all the more to leverage human potential in its uniqueness: people's creativity, empathy and collaboration skills. They must become adaptive to remain capable in a permanent VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) context. All of this will impact the way we think about organizations, leadership, people and culture.

### Build the foundation

#### Infrastructure

Reliable infrastructure is a part of the foundation. It is essential to provide accessible and secure service solutions for employees. This also means designing operations to be best suited to new operating models and dependencies.

#### Leadership

The management approaches that still remain prevalent today stem from a time when organizations were thought of as machines. It was all about optimizing all the cogs. Often with the picture that people have to be driven and motivated by incentives in order to perform. From a leadership perspective, shaping organizations of the future means intentionally challenging these assumptions. What energizes people? How does a foundation of trust become evident in our systems? What does it mean to understand organizations as living organisms that are both complex and non-linearly controllable?

#### Communication

Communication changes along with the way we work. We move towards the idea of networks and circles. To target our causes, as well as bring them together from employees, it will require the shaping of a clear vision that is shared and carried by the employees. As the paradigm shift is successfully established, the new ways of working will also shape the the future mode of communication.

#### Learn

If we follow the assumption that organizations need to position themselves for a permanent VUCA environment, then the speed of learning in particular is the key factor to survive. This relates very specifically to the entire organization, and not just to individual employees. It is the interaction, of people who are eager to learn, but as well who are given a space to rethink structures and processes to the extent that they can push the organization into a new scale of a learning corporate.

### The Magic

The magic takes place when all elements interact ideally. Fully committet employees who can participate entirely are the best lever to constantly grow a healthy organization culture. It is the art of modern work!
