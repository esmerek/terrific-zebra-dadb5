### Why Modern Work

Technology, society and organizations have changed increasingly fast over the past few years - and so has the way we work. We need to respond to these changes in a future-proof way. To remain competitive, organizations must become even more agile and able to adapt to new constraints.

### Radical Changes

We live in a digital knowledge era with global markets. It is intended that tasks will be replaced by robotics and artificial intelligence. Organizations must learn all the more to leverage human potential in its uniqueness: people's creativity, empathy and collaboration skills. They must become adaptive to remain capable in a permanent VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) context. All of this will impact the way we think about organizations, leadership, people and culture.

### Build the foundation

#### Infrastructure

Reliable infrastructure is a part of the foundation. It is essential to provide accessible and secure service solutions for employees. This also means designing operations to be best suited to new operating models and dependencies.

#### Leadership

It is always founded on leadership. Create a forward focused, collective leadership culture. Shape roles that are exceptionally engaged in driving this culture into the organization.

#### Communication

Modern work together requires an exceptional amount of communication. It is important to communicate a clear vision and key message. Regular updates and smart use of existing channels will promote awareness of modern work.

#### Engage

Engage with your employees, with your leaders, and with cross-unit stakeholder groups. Make sure everyone is represented or can get involved.

#### Evaluate

Regular retrospectives assist in reflecting on progress and learnings. Establish appropriate tools to ensure that findings are implemented long-term and that measures can be reassessed for their impact.

### Workplace Wellbeeing

The magic takes place when all elements interact ideally. Happy employees who can fully participate are the best lever to constantly grow a healthy organization culture. It is the art of modern work!
