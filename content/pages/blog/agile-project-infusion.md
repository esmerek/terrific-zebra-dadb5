#### Why to establish an agile mindset

In a VUCA world like we are experiencing these days, agile methodologies are more important than ever. The term VUCA stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity and describes the increasingly challenging handling of constantly changing conditions for an organization. In the context of digital transitions, it is essential to be able to face it with a appropriate toolset.

#### How do we find strategies to survive in the VUCA world?

We need a fundamentally new understanding of work planning and methodology. In order to be able to respond to continuously changing conditions, it is advisable to operate within short iterations. We need a clear vision and principles to guide us in order to be able to align the short-term requirements into specifications for the work-items to be done. It is the short-term planning, always in line with the vision, which allows us to respond immediately and still accomplish our objectives.

#### Scrum or Kanban?

There is no right or wrong. The Scrum framework specifies many things relatively clearly and requires that practices and roles be implemented according to guidelines. This has the advantage that issues regarding the methodology can usually be resolved quickly. At the same time, a Scrum project only works from a certain minimal workload committment and subsequent effects. Simply put, it is rather suited for large scale projects.

The Kanban approach can be seen more as an approach, as it is not a defined framework. This has the advantage that especially tight projects with different involvement of project members can be organized in a very lean and nevertheless full-value way. On the other hand, it is important to clearly define the project organization and associated artifacts for each initiative. By the way: A Kanban board is not a project methodology, it is a workflow tool (even, a particularly important one).

#### Agility InFusion

In our initiatives, we start together with an Agility InFusion. Depending on the level of knowledge, we define the suitable approach and an appropriate toolset. We make sure that everyone involved understands and supports the concept and philosophy.

#### What if we epic fail?

Congratulations! This is the first step towards learning.

> If you adopt only one agile practice let it be retrospectives. Everything else will follow.
