#### Why to establish an agile mindset

In a VUCA world like we are experiencing these days, agile methodologies are more important than ever. The term VUCA stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity and describes the increasingly challenging handling of constantly changing conditions for an organization. In the context of digital transitions, it is essential to be able to face it with a appropriate toolset.

#### How do we find strategies to survive in the VUCA world?

We need a fundamentally new understanding of planning and work methodology. In order to be able to respond to continuously changing conditions, it is advisable to operate within short iterations. We need a clear vision and principles to guide us in order to be able to align upcoming requirements into specifications for the work-items to be done. It is the short-term planning, always in line with the vision, which allows us to respond immediately and still accomplish our objectives.

#### Scrum or Kanban?

There is no right or wrong. The Scrum framework specifies many things relatively clearly and requires that practices and roles be implemented according to guidelines. This has the advantage that issues regarding the methodology can usually be resolved quickly. At the same time, a Scrum project only works from a certain minimal workload committment and subsequent effects. Simply put, it is rather suited for large scale projects.

Kanban can be seen more as an approach, as it is not a defined framework. This has the advantage that especially tight projects with varying degrees of involvement of project members can be organized in a very lean and nevertheless full-value way. On the other hand, it is important to clearly define the project organization and associated artifacts for each initiative. By the way: A Kanban board is not a project methodology, it is a workflow tool (even, a particularly important one).

#### Agility InFusion

In our initiatives, we start together with a Agility InFusion. Depending on the level of knowledge, we define the suitable approach and an appropriate toolset. We make sure that everyone involved understands and supports the concept and philosophy.

We do not limit ourselves to projects. Our Agility InFusion also works on how teams, business units, or even a complete organization define their work methods. We also support the establishment of DevOps practices for the replacement of classic development and operating models.

Together, we establish the necessary practices for the challenges of tomorrows digital work.

#### Celebrate Epic Fails!

What if we fail? Congratulations! This is the first step towards learning.

> If you adopt only one agile practice let it be retrospectives. Everything else will follow.

We cannot know everything. But we can learn every day. Agile methodologies can't see into the future any better than others. But we can respond, reflect and learn faster with the toolset of agile working methods. And we have the processes to implement improvements evolving from learnings - immediately.

Epic Fusion is fully committed to agility. Our own values and principles which we have formed derive from it.
